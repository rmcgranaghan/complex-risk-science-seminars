# Complex Risk Seminar

Welcome to the **Complex Risk Seminar** series!

Risk science is the set of approaches and research areas that bridge from the fundamental understanding to concrete and quantitative impacts that inform decision-making. It exists at the intersection of physical hazards and societal systems. Risk science is essential, underdeveloped, and ripe for new insights from physical, complexity, and social sciences. 

Scientists, government agencies, managers and operators of critical infrastructure, and commercial actors increasingly demand better tools for decision-making under deep uncertainty--tools that capture the _compounding_, _cascading_, and _concurrent_ nature of today’s risk landscape. They need predictive insight—not just for isolated hazards, but for complex system interactions. 

**Complex Risk Science** is an approach to risk science driven by complexity science, critical transitions, and resilience; seeking to understand the interconnections between hazards and infrastructures and the way those interconnections alter risk. 

This seminar series convenes the uncommon groups, almost certain not to be brought together elsewhere, required to explore the science, practice, and implications of complex risk and resilience. It builds on the foundation created during the Science Understanding from Data Science ([SUDS](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/go/suds/suds-report/)) initiative conducted internally at the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboration between 2021-2024 and then emerged into a multi-institutional movement, supporting numerous 'Horizons Initiatives.'
