# Complex Risk Seminar

Welcome to the **Complex Risk Seminar** series!

Today’s risks are not isolated—they are _compounding_, _cascading_, and _concurrent_, spanning physical hazards, social systems, and technological infrastructures. Traditional approaches struggle to keep pace with this interconnected landscape.

<!-- Scientists, government agencies, managers and operators of critical infrastructure, and commercial actors increasingly demand better tools for decision-making under deep uncertainty--tools that capture the interconnected nature of the modern risk landscape. They need predictive insight—not just for isolated hazards, but for complex system interactions. -->

Risk science is the effort to understand hazards and their impacts in ways that inform real decisions. But risk science, as it has been practiced, is underdeveloped for our moment. We need approaches that embrace complexity, uncertainty, and paradox.

**Complex Risk Science** is one such emerging approach. It draws from complexity science, resilience thinking, and critical transitions research to explore how interconnections between hazards and infrastructures reshape risk itself.

This (experimental) seminar series convenes people who rarely meet—scientists, practitioners, policymakers, and creators—to explore the science, practice, and implications of complex risk. It is a space for gathering, connecting, and discovering new ways of understanding and responding to the risks of our time. It builds on the foundation created during the Science Understanding from Data Science ([SUDS](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/go/suds/suds-report/)) initiative conducted internally at the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory between 2021-2024 and then emerged into a multi-institutional movement, supporting numerous 'Horizons Initiatives.'
