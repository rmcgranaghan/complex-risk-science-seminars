**Abstract**
The seminar will discuss different pieces of stylized modelling and empirical work engaging with the concepts of risk, uncertainty, and resilience in social-ecological and social-ecological-technological systems (SES/SETS). Applying the SES/SETS framework is not merely an acknowledgement that the systems under investigation are comprised of social and ecological and technological elements, but a shift in how these problems are conceptualized and addressed. The SES studied here include rural communities depending on local ecosystem functioning, such as fishery and pastoralist communities, while for SETS I will focus on intermittent urban water systems, differentially affecting urban managers and urban dwellers. Key to the presented work are three questions: 1) How do perceptions of and responses to risk and uncertainty shape the resilience of the affected communities? 2) How do different types of uncertainty (epistemological, ontological, frame and response uncertainty) play into their resilience? 3) What can we learn from these insights for science, governance and policy making?

**Biography**
Dr. [Elisabeth Krueger](https://kruegerelis.wixsite.com/urbantrends) is an Assistant Professor at the Institute for Biodiversity and Ecosystem Dynamics, University of Amsterdam, with a co-affiliation at the Amsterdam Institute for Social Science Research. Her research and teaching focuses on the resilience of social-ecological systems, and how human wellbeing and ecological health respond to environmental, social, and technological change. She uses complex adaptive systems methods and mixed quantitative and qualitative approaches to investigate the feedback mechanisms between the biophysical world, governance systems/social institutions, and individual and collective behaviour.
