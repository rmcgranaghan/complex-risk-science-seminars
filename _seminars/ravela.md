**Abstract**
Understanding and managing risk in today’s world requires more than averages—it demands careful attention to the extremes. In a changing climate, the tails of probability distributions may shift well before the means, challenging the way hazards are traditionally modeled and interpreted. Dr. Sai Ravela (MIT) develops methods to resolve such risks by producing detailed, large-ensemble process representations that link hazards to decisions in what he calls the “sustainability stack”: from hazard, vulnerability, and exposure to impact, risk, and ultimately policy action.

This work highlights how simplifications in modeling (“just a little physics”) shape our ability to capture risk, how downscaling alters return periods and confidence levels, and why the past is only weakly predictive of the future. Dr. Ravela will discuss the role of coherent random field mixtures, nonstationarity driven by teleconnections and anthropogenic change, and the challenges of extending these methods from relatively well-defined hazards like tropical cyclones to more complex phenomena. The seminar will explore what it means to quantify confidence rather than uncertainty, and what return levels we can truly report in the face of limited observations.

By connecting innovations in modeling with the realities of decision cycles, this talk offers a new lens on how complex risk science can support sustainable planning under deep uncertainty.

**Biography**
Dr. [Sai Ravela]([url](https://essg.mit.edu/)) is principal research scientist and director of the Earth Signals and Systems Group at MIT’s Department of Earth, Atmospheric and Planetary Sciences (EAPS) and has for more than 20 years been a research scientist at MIT, pioneering work toward Earth sustainability and computer vision. His enduring research interest is to design and use methods that can answer queries about the behavior of stochastic spatio-temporal processes. Combining climate statistics, atmospheric modeling and physics to assess the risk of future extreme events, Ravela is a pioneer of understanding risk of extreme weather in an interconnected world. He broadly studies estimation, control, decision and information theories. He has over 125 publications and patents to his name. He received the MIT Infinite Kilometer Award for exceptional research and mentorship in 2016 and is co-founder of Windrisktech LLC, which quantifies cyclone-induced risk.

His recent focus has included earth systems estimation, specifically to design algorithms that overcome the problems of nonlinearity, dimensionality and uncertainty that is characteristic of earth problems and a real barrier to effective predictability. What makes Dr. Ravela's work particularly compelling for our discussion on complex risk science is his groundbreaking research on how climate change is amplifying coastal hazards in vulnerable regions like Bangladesh. His recent work reveals how rising seas and intensifying cyclones create cascading risks that compress what were once generational threats into decade-scale realities. This intersection of physical modeling, machine learning, and real-world risk assessment exemplifies the kind of integrated approach we need to understand and manage complex, interconnected risks in our changing world.
