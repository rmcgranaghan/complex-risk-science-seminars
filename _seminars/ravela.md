**Biography**
Dr. [Sai Ravela]([url](https://essg.mit.edu/)) is principal research scientist at MITâ€™s Department of Earth, Atmospheric and Planetary Sciences (EAPS) and has for more than 20 years been a research scientist at MIT, pioneering work toward Earth sustainability and computer vision. His enduring research interest is to design and use methods that can answer queries about the behavior of stochastic spatio-temporal processes. Combining climate statistics, atmospheric modeling and physics to assess the risk of future extreme events, Ravela is a pioneer of understanding risk of extreme weather in an interconnected world. He broadly studies estimation, control, decision and information theories. His recent focus has included earth systems estimation, specifically to design algorithms that overcome the problems of nonlinearity, dimensionality and uncertainty that is characteristic of earth problems and a real barrier to effective predictability.
