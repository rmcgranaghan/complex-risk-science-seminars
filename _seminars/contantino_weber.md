**Abstract**
How individuals and communities perceive and respond to risk is deeply shaped by psychological, social, and cultural forces. While engineering and economics often conceptualize risk in terms of probabilistic outcomes, psychology understands risk as a subjective, affective, and socially mediated experience—one that varies across individuals, groups, and contexts. Risk perception research shows that emotional responses, trust in institutions, and shared narratives often outweigh formal assessments of likelihood and magnitude, and that feeling at risk powerfully motivates behavior.

This talk examines risk perception and how social norms shape and constrain collective action on climate change. Bottom-up changes in norms, expectations, and everyday practices offer an important pathway complementary to policy. We share insights from psychology, anthropology, sociology, and economics that reveal how norms are formed, how they can shift rapidly, and how they sometimes create “social tipping points” that accelerate sustainable behavior.

Finally, we turn to the political and identity-based dynamics that shape whether perceptual and social shifts can scale. Direct experience with extreme weather is often assumed to catalyze widespread climate concern, but evidence shows that political identity strongly moderates this effect. Even as extreme events intensify, motivated reasoning and partisan polarization suppress convergence in beliefs.

Therefore, this talk will discuss how risk perception, social norms, and political identity interact to shape collective responses to climate risk and why understanding these interactions is essential for designing effective interventions in a deeply divided and rapidly changing world.

**Biography**

**Dr. Sara Constantino** is an assistant professor at the Stanford Doerr School of Sustainability in the Department of Environmental Social Sciences and a visiting research scholar at Princeton's School of Public and International Affairs. She is also a faculty affiliate at SPARQ and the Social Science Environmental Health Research Institute. Her research focuses on understanding the interplay between individual, collective, institutional and ecological factors, including how they shape preferences, decisions, experiences and resilience to extreme events or shocks. Prior to starting at Stanford, she was an assistant professor in the School of Public Policy and Urban Affairs and the Department of Psychology at Northeastern University and an associate research scholar at Princeton’s School of Public and International Affairs. She received her bachelor’s degree in economics from McGill University, a master’s degree in economics from University College London, a Ph.D. in cognitive and decision sciences from New York University, and did a postdoc focused on environmental policy, politics and decision-making at Princeton University.

**Dr. Elke Weber** is the Gerhard R. Andlinger Professor in Energy and the Environment and Professor of Psychology and Public Affairs at Princeton University. She is a member of both the German and the U.S. National Academy of Sciences. In 2016, she received the Distinguished Achievement Award from the Society for Risk Analysis, in 2023 the Patrick Suppes Prize from the American Philosophical Society, and in 2024 the BBVA Frontiers of Knowledge Award in the Social Sciences.
