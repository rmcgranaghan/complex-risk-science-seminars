**Biography**
Dr. [Sai Ravela]([url](https://essg.mit.edu/))'s enduring research interest is to design and use methods that can answer queries about the behavior of stochastic spatio-temporal processes. To do so, I broadly study estimation, control, decision and information theories. Currently, I focus on earth systems estimation, specifically to design algorithms that overcome the problems of nonlinearity, dimensionality and uncertainty that is characteristic of earth problems and a real barrier to effective predictability. You can read about specific research topics on this subject and others here.
