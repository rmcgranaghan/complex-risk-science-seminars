**Abstract**
There is increasing appreciation that extreme weather risks are being altered by climate change. Unfortunately, large gaps remain between quantification of the physical hazard of these events (e.g. wind, rain, heat) and their societal impacts (e.g. deaths, structural damages). In this talk I will describe two different research areas I have engaged in seeking to connect understanding of extreme weather hazards to impacts, in particular for tropical cyclones and extreme heat. I will first briefly summarize what is known about how these events will evolve with climate change. Then I will focus on uncertainties that emerge in estimating human vulnerability to these events, which challenges our ability to confidently predict their changing impacts with global warming. I will close by emphasizing the critical role of interdisciplinary collaboration in this work, but also the difficulties that poses for forward progress in traditionally siloed academic spaces.


**Biography**
Dr. Jane Baldwin is broadly interested in how large-scale atmospheric dynamics influence regional climate and climatic extremes, with an eye to climate change and policy applications. Dr. Baldwin is currently an Assistant Professor in the Department of Earth System Science at University of California, Irvine. She was previously a Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory Postdoctoral Fellow at Columbia University developing models of tropical cyclone risk. She completed her PhD in Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences at Princeton University, collaborating with the NOAA Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory. Her dissertation used Global Climate Models to examine the influence of mountains on deserts, monsoons, and tropical cyclones. She also researched temporal structure and risk of heat waves through a PEI-STEP fellowship in joint with the Princeton School of Public and International Affairs (formerly Woodrow Wilson School). She was introduced to climate dynamics research through her senior thesis while an undergraduate studying Earth and Planetary Science at Harvard University.
